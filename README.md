## Overview 

So this repository is for the journey of me making my first keyboard: _Snowflake_. I wanted a keyboard that works for me, I wanted something that I could take with me anywhere and would work the way I designed it to do. This also was a good excuse to learn about keyboards which is something I've wanted to do for a while now.

There are two parts to this journey: [hardware](./hardware/README.md), and [software](./software/README.md). You can learn more in their respective submodules.

## Credits

This code is written by, or using the help of:

- [@Narkoleptika](https://github.com/Narkoleptika) for providing the pro micro footprint and setting me up with a template.
- [@RajuBuddharaju](https://github.com/RajuBuddharaju) for helping me realise every part of this keyboard.
- [@Tygo-van-den-Hurk](https://github.com/Tygo-van-den-Hurk)
